# 🔓 ROX

**XOR Key Recovery Tool**

ROX is a Python command-line utility that recovers XOR encryption keys using known file signatures (magic headers).

---
## 🗄️ Signature Database

ROX uses a file named **`dict.bin`** that contains known file signatures (magic headers) used during the analysis process.

### 🔍 How It Works

* 📂 `dict.bin` stores potential file header signatures.
* 🔑 ROX compares these signatures against the encrypted file.
* 🧩 The tool attempts to derive XOR keys capable of producing valid headers.
* 🔄 Repeating patterns in the recovered data are analyzed to identify likely XOR keys.
* 📄 Matching headers can help determine the original file type even when the file extension is missing or unknown.

### 🎯 Purpose

This functionality is particularly useful when analyzing files that have been obfuscated using a **single-byte XOR cipher** and the original file format is unknown.

### 💡 Example Workflow
